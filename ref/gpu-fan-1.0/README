gpu-fan (GPU-based  Fast Analysis of Networks) 
---------------------------------------

Network analysis plays an important role in systems biology. However, network analysis algorithms are 
usually computationally intensive. Mordern General Purpose computation on Graphics Processing Units 
(GPGPUs) provides a cost-effective platform for this type of applications. We have initiated a 
project to enable fast network analysis on GPUs. The first verison of the software package gpu-fan 
(GPU-based Fast Analysis of Networks) includes a set of programs for computing several widely used 
shortest path based centrality on CUDA enabled GPU devices. Supported centrality metrics are: 

* The Betweeness Centrality (BC) is the ratio of all geodesics between pairs of 
  nodes which run through each node. It reflects how often an node lies on the 
  geodesics between the other nodes of the network.

* Closeness Centrality (CC) is the invert sum of the shortest distances between each
  node and every other node. 

* Eccentricity Centrality (EC) of a node k is the largest geodesic distance (k,t) 
  from every other vertex. Therefore, EC(u) reflects how far, at most, is each 
  node from every other node. 

* The Stress Centrality (SC) of a node k is the total number of 
  geodesics between all other nodes which run through k.
  
  ^ The closeness (eccentricity)  centrality is normalized to to n'-1 / n-1 where n 
    is the number of nodes in the connected part of graph containing the node, n 
    is the size of the graph. If the graph is not completely connected, this algorithm 
    computes the closeness (eccentricity) centrality for each connected part separately.


gpu-fan was developed on Linux, and it should compile without
modification on most modern UNIX systems. Other operating systems may
require minor changes to the source code.

Installation

See INSTALLATION file in the current directory


-------------------------------------------
Run:

* Graph format:

Currently it supports graph edge list format where each line of the 
input file represents an edge in the graph with the format:

NODEA NODEB  

The node names are delimited by a TAB.

For help, run:

UNIX> centrality-gpu --help

There are some example graphs in directory src/tests

To run the CPU version, use centrality-cpu.
