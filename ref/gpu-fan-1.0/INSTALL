Install instruction
--------------------

Requirement:
-----------
  cmake version 2.8 or above: this include a module that detects CUDA installation (www.cmake.org).
  CUDA enabled GPU device with compute cabibility 2.0 or above (which supports atomic operation on floating point numbers)          

 
Steps:
----------
 * untar the package:
   UNIX> tar xvfz gpu-fan-1.0.tar.gz
 
 * go to the newly created directory and do a cmake. By default the binaries will be installed in the source code 
   directory. If you want to install at different location,  please provide a path to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
   By default, it assumes that CUDA is installed at /usr/local/cuda.  If your system has CUDA installed on 
   another location, please set the value CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR properly.

   UNIX> cd gpu-fan-1.0
   UNIX> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation/gpu-fan-1.0 -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/CUDA/installation .
   (notice the "." at the end of the previous command)
 
 * build and install
   UNIX> make
   UNIX> make install

 You should see the executables being installed at /path/to/your/installation/gpu-fan-1.0/bin .
 
 * to clean the build
   UNIX> make clean
